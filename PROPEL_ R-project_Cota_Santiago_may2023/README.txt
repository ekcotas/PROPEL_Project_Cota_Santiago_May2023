PROPEL Stats Course Final Project By: Erika Cota and Natalia Santiago The data set being used in this project has information about people's behavior as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses. The data is divided by country and was collected using monthly surveys where people were asked whether they participate in certain activities and how much they agree with provided statements on scale of 0-100.Using this data set we are interested in seeing how cleanliness behaviors change as the pandemic progresses and how these behavioral patterns change between the United States and Japan. We specifically chose cleanliness because personal hygiene was heavily impacted by the pandemic. We chose to look at the United States and Japan specifically because we wanted to see if global location affected the behavioral trends.  This data set is quite extensive containing many aspects of behavior and followed them as they changed during the pandemic. If you are interested in peoples behaviors we recomend you have fun and checking some trends for your self :)All libraries necessary are included in the code notebook. The link to the original data set is provided below if you prefer, but it has been loaded to the code.  DATA SET LINK: <https://corgis-edu.github.io//corgis/csv/covid_behaviors/>We have also created a short video discussing some of the graphs created in the notebook and the conclusions drawn from the data visualization.
